Features
--------



[❌] King of the Beacon
    - simple pyramid made of 4 layers + beacon block (9x9 minimum)
    - need to be neutral placeable at the start of a match
    - logic to change ownership to whoever has the most units nearby, with some slight inertia
    - timer to determine who wins (win via total time accumulated)
    - must ignore all attack commands and be indestructible
    - starts out entirely made of stone brick, but deposit ore to be upgraded into ore blocks from the top down
        - level 1: regen
        - level 2: strength
        - level 3: resistance
        - level 4: speed
    - instead of scaffolding underneath, place some other brick blocks
    - add a UI later to show the effects, for now just have a number next to name showing how much ore to next tier)



Bugfixes
--------

[❌] Central portals sometimes do not ignite (and this somehow makes grunts spawn underground)

[❌] Must restart client when switching languages for it to take effect



Quality of Life Features
------------------------

[❌] Flatten terrain ability
    - Require that villagers work on it like a building
    - Will need a new flatten zone object (no need to save it)

[❌] Amethyst is now mineable, and regenerates automatically after 1min

[❌] Getters and Setters for unit stats



Balancing
---------

[❌] Solution to discourage rushing
    - allow villagers to shoot out of garrisons?

[❌] Lightning should only charge one creeper at a time

[❌] - Upgrade gives stimpacks (-10hp for 10s of double attack speed and speed buff, cant be used while mounted)
