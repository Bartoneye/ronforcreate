    - timer to determine who wins (win via total time accumulated)
    - must ignore all attack commands and be indestructible
    - starts out entirely made of stone brick, but deposit ore to be upgraded into ore blocks from the top down
        - level 1: regen
        - level 2: strength
        - level 3: resistance
        - level 4: speed
    - instead of scaffolding underneath, place some other brick blocks
    - add a UI later to show the effects, for now just have a number next to name showing how much ore to next tier)

Bugfixes
--------

[❌] With high lag, units waiting to be queued at 99% become uncancellable
    - https://discord.com/channels/1294953087567663135/1306165740730322986

[❌] Central portals sometimes do not ignite (and this somehow makes grunts spawn underground)

[❌] Must restart client when switching languages for it to take effect

[❌] Tall grass and barrier blocks are now ignored by the cursor



Quality of Life Features
------------------------

    - Add recursive field to UnitActionItem: nextActionItem
    - Add end detections in goals for when to move to nextActionItem
    - Add clientside checkpoints

[❌] Flatten terrain ability

Balancing
---------

[❌] Solution to discourage rushing
    - villagers are most vulnerable due to their lategame nature

        - give them a helmet and stone sword upgrade for +2 damage
        - turn back on isPushable

    - and provide a radius indicator for them when hovering over explode
