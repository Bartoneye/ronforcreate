Quality of Life
---------------

Balancing
---------

[✔] Reworked ore blocks to increase their value, but reduce their speed of gathering
    - Changed value of ore blocks:
        - Ore: 40 -> 50 (this means workers drop off after 1 block mined)
        - Iron/copper: 60 -> 65
        - Gold/emerald: 80 -> 80 (unchanged)
        - Diamond: 120 -> 100
    - Piglin ores still give +20% value when converted
    - Increased all gather times by 50%

[🟡] All new capitols may now build workers

**Villagers**

[✔] Militia range increased to 60 blocks
[✔] Militia: +3 move speed (same speed as most melee units)

**Monsters**

[✔] Creeper: -3 move speed (same speed as most ranged units)

**Piglins**

[🟡] Blazes now only fire at half speed while garrisoned
    - This is because they produce much more fire blocks when garrisoned, massively increasing their damage output
