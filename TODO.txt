Bugfixes
--------

[🟡] Portals can sometimes stack the same upgrade if they're upgraded with multiple selected

[🟡] Vindicators can no longer spawn with random enchantments on their equipment

[🟡] Ranged units now stagger their attack speeds by a few ticks randomly
    - This is to work around Minecraft's built-in 1-tick invincibility frames

[🟡] Animals cannot spawn on Y levels too different to your capitol

[🟡] Queued units no longer progress if you're at the population cap instead of being stuck at 99%
    - This is to fix an issue of being able to go over the max cap when the server is lagging

[🟡] Creepers no longer explode when using /rts-reset
    - This was to fix a bug where the reset failed if a creeper exploded from it

[🟡] Fixed not being able to upgrade two labs at the same time

[🟡] Fixed crash related to transport portals

[🟡] Fixed sonic booms cancelling the first warden's charge up instead of cycling to the next one


Quality of Life Features
------------------------

[✔] /gamerule doMobSpawning is now turned off by default

[🟡] The warpten cheatcode now also makes buildings build themselves without workers

[✔] All buildings can now be built directly adjacent to each other
    - This means you can use houses as walls (but you won't be able to shoot past them)

[✔] Spectators can see what's being produced on anyone's buildings



Balancing
---------

[✔] All factions may build additional capitols, but only one can produce workers at any given time
    - you can also now delete capitols if you have more than one

[✔] Ghasts: +10s build time, +1 pop

[✔] Creeper friendly fire is halved and friendly fire to other creepers is quartered

[✔] Reduced charged creeper explosion power to 5
    - For reference, standard creeper power is 3 and charged is 6
    - Also reduced charged creeper damage to buildings from 40 to 34

[🟡] Reworked Wither Skeletons:
    - Wither Skeleton: -4 dmg, -0.1as
    - Wither on hit is now stackable up to 5 times
        - At maximum stacks: 1 dmg every 0.2s (5 dmg per second)
    - Wither duration reduced from 7 to 6 seconds
    - All stacks disappear if the duration expires
    - Wither cloud duration increased to 15 seconds
    - Removed withering melee enemies that attack a wither skeleton
    - Removed passive bonus damage to damaged targets
