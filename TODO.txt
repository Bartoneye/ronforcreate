-------------

Tthings to regression test once PRs are merged
- /gamerule neutralAggro still works
- cycling unit groups with tab and shift tab
- all tooltips for multiple languages


- Done and tested
[✔] Done and tested
[🟡] Partially done, only has a workaround and/or needs testing
[❌] Not done, including unmerged PRs

Features
--------
(In Optimize and Crash Fixes #107 PR)
[❌] Alliance System (Thanks to @Boobcat)
    - /ally <player name> to send an alliance request to another player
    - /allyconfirm <requester name> to accept an alliance request
    - /disband to leave an alliance
    - Allies are shown as blue in unit/building highlights and the minimap
    - Allies win and lose together
    - Allying a player will not automatically ally you with their allies
    - Effects that don't friendly fire like creepers should also not affect allies
    - You can still force attack allies using A + left-click

[❌] Localisation Keys (Thanks to @Promethia)
    - All strings in the mod are now translatable
    - If a string in your locale is not available, it will default to English
    - Due to an unforseen bug, you must restart your client when switching languages for it to take effect
    - Languages completed so far are English (en_us) and Chinese (Simplified) (zh_cn)
    - If you would like to contribute translations, please make a pull request to the Github here:

Bugfixes
--------
(In Optimize and Crash Fixes #107 PR)

[❌] Improved performance for all buildings
[❌] Fixed crash related to Hiding Leaves
[❌] Fixed crash related to Ranged units attacking buildings

[🟡] Fixed issue of being kicked from the official server when switching instances (eg. between a game and the lobby)
[❌] The world generation datapack is now hardcoded into the mod by default
    - as a world gen option like superflat
[❌] Reduce melee unit repathing rate if out of melee range
    - "Made melee unit pathing slightly dumber to improve performance by a lot (they still chase slower units correctly)"
