1.19.2-1.0.9
-------------

- Done and tested
[✔] Done and tested
[🟡] Partially done and/or needs testing
[❌] Not done, including unmerged PRs

Features
--------
[🟡] Wave Survival
    - Designed to be played on vanilla generated worlds
    - Whenever night begins, a wave of enemies will spawn to attack your base
    - No win condition... just keep going until you die
    - Your capitol being destroyed is an instant loss
    - base day length depends on difficulty
        - 10mins - easy
        - 8mins - medium
        - 6mins - hard
    - nights last forever until you clear the wave, but the next day becomes longer or shorter
        depending on how long it took you to clear the wave

    DESIGN NOTES
    - might need improved pathfinding first :(
    - Each night is either piglin, illager or monster
        - Monsters attack from all directions randomly at random targets
        - Illagers attack in a large group from one direction
        - Piglins get popup portals that continuously send units
            - each portal spawns a small wave to and must be destroyed before the wave ends
        - can't be the same faction twice in a row
        - as days pass, waves get larger (balanced by population value)

    [❌] Save on exit
    [❌] Units sometimes get stuck without walking across water

    [❌] Cave sounds are localised in the world
    [❌] Check that defeat doesn't bug out the world
        - should unlock gamemode?




[🟡] Bloodlust ability
    - Unlockable active ability for Brutes and Headhunters
    - Researched at the Fortress (250 all resources, 150s)
    - When used, instantly trades 10hp for 10s of +50% attack speed and +50% movement speed
    - Headhunters cannot bloodlust while mounted


Bugfixes
--------
[🟡] Mangrove roots are now gatherable (same value as logs)

[🟡] Fixed being unable to exit an ally's garrison

[✔] Hoglins can no longer spawn as neutral baby hoglins from spawn eggs

[🟡] Reworked unit and building data saving when the server shuts down
    - This should reduce the issue of losing control of units/buildings when the server crashes

[🟡] Piglins can now build on all types of blackstone and nether brick

[🟡] Farmland and overworld crops convert into soulsand and nether wart respectively
    - Excludes solid crop blocks like melons and pumpkins
    - Plant blocks replaced by nether blocks no longer drop items

[🟡] Fixed crash related to attacking buildings (again)

[✔] Shroomlight is now gatherable for 120 food

[✔] Various language fixes and additions


Quality of Life Features
------------------------
[🟡] Added a gamemode selector next to faction selction buttons
    - Used to swap between Standard, Wave Survival and future gamemodes
    - Once a player joins the match, the game mode they chose is locked for everyone until /rts-reset is used
    - Mapmakers can use /gamerule disallowWaveSurvival to prevent players from choosing wave survival

[🟡] Added sounds when you make or disband an alliance

[🟡] Added name checks to network packets to prevent exploits

[🟡] If animals can't spawn at the required range around your capitol, spawning is reattempted at a closer range

[✔] Portals being placed on overworld terrain show a yellow indicator

[🟡] Witch potions can now be thrown by right-clicking a unit
    - Right-clicking a friendly unit throws a regen potion
    - Right-clicking an enemy unit throws a harming potion
    - Only one potion is thrown at a time if multiple witches are selected
    - This will NOT be automatically used off cooldown
