Bugfixes
--------

[❌] Pathing around fire is weird

[❌] can't build on sculk



[❌] Clicking tops of trees may make workers idle and mess up pathfinding
    - If blockPos hasn't changed for 5s, just null gatherTarget and let them look for new nearby resources
    - Also check out Potato345's tree chop issue
        - Seed: 1936221877834802093

[✔] If the server host changed any resource cost configs, this is now shown next to the start buttons
    - These are relative to your own configs
    - For example, if Zombies officially cost 75 food, you personally changed this to 65, and your server host changed it to 85, the tooltip will show a +20 increase
    [🟡] check relogging in and out of a change server does what you expect

[✔] Fixed an issue where population was going over maximum on clientside

[✔] Heavy Tridents now shows an enchanted effect on the tridents

[✔] Animals can no longer spawn on barrier blocks
