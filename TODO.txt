1.19.2-1.0.9
-------------

- Done and tested
[✔] Done and tested
[🟡] Partially done, only has a workaround and/or needs testing
[❌] Not done, including unmerged PRs

Features
--------
[❌] Wave Survival
    - Start anywhere, set time to morning
    - Whenever night begins, spawn wave of enemies to attack move your base

    - play a random cave ambience sound at the start of each night and title function
    - start off doing only monster enemies
    - lose if your capitol dies
    - need to make sure enemies don't spawn too close to your buildings
    - might need improved pathfinding
        - for now, just keep repeating attack move commands
        - can use boobcat's pathfinding improvements for enemies by default
    - each day length depends on difficulty
        - 10mins - easy (same as vanilla length)
        - 8mins - medium
        - 6mins - hard
    - nights last forever until you clear the wave
    - add button to look for few remaining units (similar to idle villagers button)

    WAVE DESIGN
    - Each night is either piglin, illager or monster
        - Piglins get popup portals that continuously send units
            - medium sized wave from each portal at start (smaller than an illager wave) and
            - must be destroyed before the wave ends
            - cannot be damaged while building, builds extra fast
            - at least 1 portal targets the capitol
        - Monsters attack from all directions randomly at random targets
        - Illagers attack in a large group always focusing the capitol
        - can't be the same faction twice in a row
        - as days pass, waves get larger (balanced by population value)

    ANTI-CHEESING
    - Give enemies all frostwalker to allow islands
        - But won't work on sky maps
    - Prevent leaving one enemy alive to farm resources forever
        - At least some proportion of enemies try to focus workers
        - X enemies or less remaining, all enemies focus on workers

    VANILLA WORLD COMPATIBILITY
    - Players are forced to expand further to keep getting resources, but always have to protect their capitol



[🟡] Bloodlust ability
    - Unlockable active ability for Brutes and Headhunters
    - Researched at the Fortress (250 all resources, 150s)
    - When used, instantly trades 10hp for 10s of +50% attack speed and +50% movement speed
    - Headhunters cannot bloodlust while mounted


Bugfixes
--------
[🟡] Can't exit an ally's garrison

[❌] Tall grass and barrier blocks are now ignored by the cursor

[✔] Hoglins can no longer spawn as neutral baby hoglins from spawn eggs

[❌] Save more often to prevent crashing affecting the game

[✔] Separate night and 'until night' strings for polish



Quality of Life Features
------------------------

[🟡] Witch potions can now be thrown by right-clicking a unit

    - Right-clicking an enemy unit throws a harming potion
    - Only one potion is thrown at a time if multiple witches are selected
    - This will NOT be automatically used off cooldown
