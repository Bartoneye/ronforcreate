Wave Survival 0.4
-----------------
[🟡] Enemy units no longer try to attack bridges or pile up near them
[🟡] Provide 50% refund for deleting a completed building (scaled to how damaged it is)

[❌] In wave survival, teams randomly switch
[🟡] Ranged units no longer pile up inside buildings

[🟡] Wave difficulty is advanced on each night regardless of if you cleared the previous wave or not
[🟡] The spawn warning is now only shown if less than the expected number of units spawned
    - If you see one of these warnings, please open a bug report and show a screenshot of your world

[❌] Added more debug options:
    - /debug-next-night - advances to the next night and wave
    - /debug-set-wave - sets the next wave number


Portal fixes
------------
[🟡] Reduced portal count from 1/2 to 1/3 of wave number but with the same total population each wave
[🟡] Portals can no longer spawn over water (but they can still spawn on land across water)
[🟡] Portals can no longer spawn too close to another portal
[🟡] Piglin waves now have a population cap for units spawned from portals (2x of other waves)
[🟡] Enemy ghasts no longer friendly fire their own portals

Features
--------
[🟡] Pathfinding fixes
    - Test for performance
    - Ignore recalculations if the target pos is the same as current
    - If the first unit in a group tries to go to an impossible path (eg. an island), then just send all other units
        - in the group to the last pos in the node list of the first unit


Bugfixes
--------

[🟡] Spectators can no longer cancel units from RTS players' building queues
    - test in lilypad server?
[🟡] Fixed some units randomly spawning as neutral
[🟡] Can no longer enter enemy garrisons
    - You can still enter allied garrisons
[🟡] Tall grass and barrier blocks are now ignored by the cursor
[🟡] Only save resource data if the unit was actively gathering
[🟡] Fix weird pathing over magma
    - To fix this, there is now a new block identical in texture and function to magma called "Walkable Magma"
    - @Mapmakers should replace any regular magma blocks in their maps with this block to improve pathfinding
[❌] Fix #localisation channel problems
[❌] Wipe all saved data on /rts-reset


Quality of Life
---------------

[❌] If neutralAggro is on, don't aggro allied survival players

[🟡] Reduced volume of the Call To Arms bell when used by villagers

[🟡] Show refund resources popup when cancelling buildings
    - consider switching to SC2 system? (flat 75% refund)

[❌] Shift queueing movements and buildings (not just placement)
    - Add index to sendCommand packets
    - Add recursive field to UnitActionItem: nextActionItem
        - OR just add a list queue to each unit
    - Add end detections in goals for when to move to nextActionItem
    - Add clientside checkpoints

[❌] Must restart client when switching languages for it to take effect
    - Should do configs first

[❌] /gamerule groundYLevel for mapmakers
    - Maybe separate for ghasts and bridges?

[❌] Right click to autocast repair on workers

Balancing
---------
[❌] De-RNG farm growth, and properly measure their output for balancing

[✔] Spiders & Poison Spiders: +1 dmg

[🟡] Capitols after the first take twice as long to build
