Bugfixes
--------

[🟡] Portals can sometimes stack the same upgrade if they're upgraded with multiple selected
[🟡] Vindicators can no longer spawn with random enchantments on their equipment
[🟡] Ranged units now stagger their attack speeds by a few ticks randomly
    - This is to work around Minecraft's built-in 1-tick invincibility frames
[🟡] Animals cannot spawn on Y levels too different to your capitol
[🟡] Queued units no longer progress if you're at the population cap instead of being stuck at 99%
    - This is to fix an issue of being able to go over the max cap when the server is lagging
[🟡] Creepers no longer explode when using /rts-reset
    - This was to fix a bug where the reset failed if a creeper exploded from it
[🟡] Fixed not being able to upgrade two labs at the same time
[🟡] Fixed crash related to transport portals
[🟡] Fixed sonic booms cancelling the first warden's charge up instead of cycling to the next one


Quality of Life Features
------------------------

[✔] /gamerule doMobSpawning is now turned off by default
[🟡] The warpten cheatcode now also makes buildings build themselves without workers
[✔] All buildings can now be built directly adjacent to each other
    - This means you can use houses as walls (but you won't be able to shoot past them)
[✔] Spectators can see what's being produced on anyone's buildings



Balancing
---------

[✔] All factions may build additional capitols, but only one can produce workers at any given time
    - you can also now delete capitols if you have more than one
[✔] Ghasts: +10s build time, +1 pop
[✔] Creeper friendly fire is halved and friendly fire to other creepers is quartered
[✔] Reduced charged creeper explosion power to 5
    - For reference, standard creeper power is 3 and charged is 6
    - Also reduced charged creeper damage to buildings from 40 to 34
