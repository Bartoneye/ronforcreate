1.19.2-1.0.10
-------------

- Done and tested
[✔] Done and tested
[🟡] Partially done and/or needs testing
[❌] Not done, including unmerged PRs



Wave Survival
-------------

[✔] Default the gamemode selector to survival

[🟡] Fixed enemies being stuck while trying to attack

[🟡] You now lose when all buildings are destroyed instead of just your capitol, just like in multiplayer

[✔] Raised quantity of spawns for all waves

[✔] Skeletons can now spawn on the first wave

[🟡] Improved spawn location logic again
    - This time, enemies only try to spawn near your outermost buildings to avoid a chance of a wave failing to spawn
    - If none or less than the required enemies spawned, a warning is sent to all players
        - If you see this warning, please tell me and show me a screenshot of your base and map

[✔] Waves now go up to 30, maxing out at 700 total population worth of enemies
    - The spawn logic is likely going to bug out by this point and not actually spawn that many units
    - (I wasn't able to test this properly because I was afraid of melting my PC)

[🟡] Mob frostwalker now works on lava by turning the lava into netherrack

[🟡] Added Illager waves
    - Illagers spawn in one large group

[🟡] Added Piglin waves
    - Piglins spawn from portals which pop up at the start of the night
    - Half of the wave's population is spawned immediately
    - Portals will spawn a random enemy every 30 seconds until destroyed
    - Can spawn over water or lava


Features
--------

Villager Militia
    - Town Centres and villagers now have a 'Call to Arms' button
    - When used, they run to the nearest Town Centre to be turned into a Militia unit
    - Militia have 35 HP and 3 damage but cannot do regular worker activities
    - Militia transform back into villagers any time with a button or if they move 50 blocks away from the town centre
    - Militia only do 1 damage to huntable animals
    - Added a bell to the town centre

Bugfixes
--------

[🟡] Portals can sometimes stack the same upgrade if they're upgraded with multiple selected

[🟡] Illagers can no longer spawn with random enchantments on their equipment

[🟡] Ranged units now stagger their attack speeds by a few ticks randomly
    - This is to work around Minecraft's built-in 1-tick invincibility frames

[🟡] Animals cannot spawn on Y levels too different to your capitol

[🟡] Queued units no longer progress if you're at the population cap instead of being stuck at 99%
    - This is to fix an issue of being able to go over the max cap when the server is lagging

[🟡] Creepers no longer explode when using /rts-reset
    - This was to fix a bug where the reset failed if a creeper exploded from it

[🟡] Fixed not being able to upgrade two labs at the same time



Quality of Life Features
------------------------

[🟡] The warpten cheatcode now also makes buildings build themselves without workers

[✔] All buildings can now be built directly adjacent to each other
    - This means you can use houses as walls (but you won't be able to shoot past them)

[🟡] Right click to toggle whether sonic booms are one-click-one-cast or not

[✔] Spectators can see what's being produced on anyone's buildings



Balancing
---------

[✔] All factions may build additional capitols, but only one can produce workers at any given time
    - you can also now delete capitols if you have more than one

[✔] Ghasts: +10s build time, +1 pop

[✔] Creeper friendly fire is halved and friendly fire to other creepers is quartered

[✔] Reduced charged creeper explosion power to 5
    - For reference, standard creeper power is 3 and charged is 6
    - Also reduced charged creeper damage to buildings from 40 to 34

[❌] Add wither upgrade that lets them stack wither on a single enemy
    - Remove +% damage passive to damaged targets
