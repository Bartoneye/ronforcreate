Features
--------

[🟡] Magma cubes
    - Produced from Military Portals after building a Basalt Springs
    - Costs 40 of each resource
    - Sets enemies on fire when attacking or being attacked by melee
    - Starts off at size 2, but can be raised to size 6 by eating other cubes
    - Larger size == higher damage, HP, fire duration and population usage
    - Upgrade to create temporary magma blocks around it constantly
    - Does not split in half on death
    [❌] Attack when landing from a jump instead of regular melee attack logic

[✔] Ghast Upgrade: Soul Fireballs
    - Ghasts create soulsand and soulfires which pierce fire resistance on impact

[🟡] Villager Professions
    - All villagers now level up into professions when they perform specific activities enough times
    - Each profession has a standard level and a veteran level
    - Takes roughly 2-3mins to gain a profession, and another 2-3mins to become a veteran
    - Professions cannot be changed once gained
    - **Farmer**: plants crops worth +1/+2 food (carrots and potatoes)
    - **Lumberjack**: chops logs +25%/+50% faster
    - **Miner**: mines ores +25%/+50% faster

    [🟡] Save on exit
    [🟡] Save on militia conversion
    [🟡] Veteran upgrade (2.5mins to get profession, then 5mins to get veteran)
        - Show diamond tools when veteran
    [❌] Profession arm colours are all wrong


Bugfixes
--------

[🟡] Fixed production queue desyncing with a laggy server (again)
    - This also hopefully fixes the appearance of being over population cap

[🟡] Fixed ability cooldown desyncing with a laggy server

[🟡] Misc. pathfinding improvements and optimisations including while chopping wood and walking in fire

[✔] Fixed militia not showing their headgear



Quality of Life
---------------

[🟡] Melee units stop moving once in range of their target so they don't constantly push large mobs

[✔] Changed fire resistance research icon

[🟡] Spiders now move towards their target before webbing
    - Test that poison spiders still work correctly

[🟡] Added /gamerule survivalGriefing (default true)
    - Allows survival players to break blocks that aren't for resources or part of a building

[🟡] Added /gamerule improvedPathfinding (default true)
    - Turns off the pathfinding improvements to reduce server CPU usage

[🟡] Added /gamerule groundYLevel (default -9999)
    - Set to any positive value to lock the camera height to above this level
    [❌] Include ghasts and bridges

[❌] review what config options can be added
    - camera panning speed

[❌] Right click map button to lock the map location


Balancing
---------

[✔] Reworked ore blocks to increase their value, but reduce their speed of gathering
    - Changed value of ore blocks:
        - Ore: 40 -> 50 (this means workers drop off after 1 block mined)
        - Iron/copper: 60 -> 65
        - Gold/emerald: 80 -> 80 (unchanged)
        - Diamond: 120 -> 100
    - Piglin ores still give +20% value when converted
    - Increased all gather times by 50%

[🟡] All new capitols may now build workers

**Villagers**

[✔] Militia range increased to 60 blocks
[✔] Militia: +3 move speed (same speed as most melee units)

**Monsters**

[✔] Creeper: -3 move speed (same speed as most ranged units)

**Piglins**

[🟡] Blazes now only fire at half speed while garrisoned
    - This is because they produce much more fire blocks when garrisoned, massively increasing their damage output
