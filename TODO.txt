1.19.2-1.0.9
-------------

- Done and tested
[✔] Done and tested
[🟡] Partially done and/or needs testing
[❌] Not done, including unmerged PRs

Wave Survival
--------
[❌] Improve spawn logic again for any number of buildings
[❌] Default the gamemode selector to survival
[❌] Don't make the capitol destroyed be a game loss
    - allow multiple capitols to be built, but only one allowed to build units at a time

Bugfixes
--------
[❌] Remove tutorial popup
[❌] Ranged units stagger their attack speeds by a few ticks randomly
    - This is to work around Minecraft's built-in 1-tick invincibility frames


Quality of Life Features
------------------------

[❌] Shift queueing movements and buildings (not just placement)
    - Add index to sendCommand packets
    - Add recursive field to UnitActionItem: nextActionItem
        - OR just add a list queue to each unit
    - Add end detections in goals for when to move to nextActionItem
    - Add clientside checkpoints


Balancing
---------
[✔] Ghasts: -1 damage to buildings, +20s build time, +1 pop

[❌] Solution to discourage rushing
    - villagers are most vulnerable due to their lategame nature
    - copy the wc3 ability of turning villagers into temporary militia?
        - give them a helmet and stone sword upgrade for +2 damage
        - turn back on isPushable
    OR just allow all workers to shoot out of garrisons
    what could piglins have?

[❌] Add wither upgrade that lets them stack wither on a single enemy
    - Remove +% damage passive to damaged targets
