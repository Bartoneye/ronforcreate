- Done and testedZ
[✔] Done and tested
[🟡] Partially done and/or needs testing
[❌] Not done, including unmerged PRs



Wave Survival 0.5
------------------
[✔] Enemies from different factions should no longer attack each other
[✔] Added mounted units for all enemy factions
[✔] Added creepers and charged creepers - they ignore all units and will explode at the nearest building
[❌] Enemies more consistently spawn with ice below them when over water
[✔] Unit tiers increase every 3rd wave now instead of every 2nd

[❌] Fixed a bug where teams would randomly switch



Features
--------
[🟡] Improved pathfinding accuracy for all units
    - Increasing the accuracy also increased server CPU usage, so several optimisations have also been included:
        - If the last move command is identical to the current one (same units, same location, etc.) the command is ignored
        - When moving far distances (>50 blocks), some commands are ignored if the last move command was to a similar location
        - Move commands across water/lava are ignored if the unit would not move as a result (eg. they're stuck at the coast)

[❌] Configurable Unit Costs (Thanks to @DoodleNoodles)
    - Includes all costs, population values and build times
    - Modify the files generated at configs/reignofnether-config.toml to adjust them
    - If the server config is adjusted, this will be enforced for all players joining the match

Bugfixes
--------
[🟡] Spectators can no longer cancel units from RTS players' building queues
    - test in lilypad server?
[🟡] Only save resource data if the unit was actively gathering

[❌] You no longer have to restart your client to change button languages

Quality of Life
---------------
[✔] Add gamerule for explosions breaking terrain /gamerule doUnitGriefing (false by default)


Languages
---------
Vietnamese added (thanks to @hungtq1016)
