Wave Survival 0.4a
------------------
[❌] Enemies from different factions should not attach each other
[❌] Fixed a bug where teams would randomly switch

Features
--------
[🟡] Improved pathfinding accuracy for all units
    - Increasing the accuracy also increased server CPU usage, so several optimisations have also been included:
        - If the last move command is identical to the current one (same units, same location, etc.) the command is ignored
        - When moving far distances (>50 blocks), some commands are ignored if the last move command was to a similar location
        - Move commands across water/lava are ignored if the unit would not move as a result (eg. they're stuck at the coast)

[❌] Configurable Unit Costs (Thanks to @DoodleNoodles)
    - Includes all costs, population values and build times
    - Modify the files generated at configs/reignofnether-config.toml to adjust them
    - If the server config is adjusted, this will be enforced for all players joining the match


Bugfixes
--------
[🟡] Spectators can no longer cancel units from RTS players' building queues
    - test in lilypad server?
[🟡] Fixed some units randomly spawning as neutral
[🟡] Only save resource data if the unit was actively gathering

[❌] Wipe all saved data on /rts-reset
[❌] Wipe specific data before save actions
[❌] You no longer have to restart your client to change button languages

Quality of Life
---------------

[✔] Moving the camera to a unit or building is now more accurately centered
